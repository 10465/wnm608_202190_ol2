  <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
  <p>Nima Behnoud is a digital artist and entrepreneur living in New York City. He graduated from Fashion Institute of Technology with a BA in Graphic Design and a MA in Global Fashion Management. He started his career as a graphic designer for advertising agencies in California. He moved to New York in 1999, where he worked as a creative director for Cartier, L'Oreal and Jacob & Co (Jacob The Jeweler) he made video campaigns with footballers Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. </p>
  <p>Nima’s artistic journey is based on his life-long love for painting and illustration. Mixing silk screening, digital media and fabric pigments, he created a unique style early in his career. He had sold-out solo exhibitions of his fine art works in New York, Paris and Dubai. His works became an inspiration for launching a clothing and accessories brand NIMANY in 2005. NIMANY, which was based on Nima’s cumulative experience of years in computer graphics, fine arts and luxury markets, went on to become more successful than most could have imagined: It found a large cult following that has remained loyal to Nima’s work, whether paintings, luxury hand-bags or fragrances which were launched in 2017. Its limited designs, sold exclusively through NIMANY’s online boutique and Fred Segal boutiques, have continued to be met with an enthusiastic reception from a growing market. </p>
  <p>Nima is also proud that his alma mater, New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology, has selected him as a profile student, praising him for his innovative use of silk screening and Persian calligraphy.</p>
  <p>The central art of Nima Behnoud’s painting is a result of many individual pieces of Nastaliq practices known as “Siyah Mashgh” combined together. These scriptures are infused into each other to create a visual experience. The stamps and seals on this painting are often used by the Qajar dynasty during the 17th century. Nastaliq is one of the main script styles used in Persian calligraphy. It was developed in Iran in the 8th and 9th centuries. It has extensively been (and still is) practiced in Iran as a form of art. Nastaliq is the core script of the Persian writing tradition. Siah Masq: Siah-Masq ("inked drill") panels however communicate via composition and form, rather than content. In Siah-Masq, repeating a few (sometimes even one) letters or words virtually inks the whole panel. The content is thus of less significance and not clearly accessible.

“I have kept a secret during these years when NIMANY Clothing line was growing. A personal secret that allow me to think without the boundaries of business world created by the expansion of NIMANY. The Secret was an art studio in the remote section of New York. A secluded location where I could express myself freely and recreate that very first organic artistic experience over and over again.

I worked there on weekends and nights and created art pieces on canvas and paper, using acrylic paints, silk screens and other painting methods. I rescued my sanity and mind by building my own refuge. My very private safe-house”.</p>
